# Configuring OpenNext for use in an Nx Monorepo.
Here's a detailed exampled of how to add open-next + SST to an existing Nx workspace, with an existing NextJS application sitting at `apps/next-site`

1. install `open-next`: `pnpm add —save-dev open-next`

2. Update your `apps/next-site/next.config.js` add `output: ‘standalone’`, and you want to add `experimental.outputFileTracingRoot`, it should look a little like this: 
```javascript
//@ts-check
 
// eslint-disable-next-line @typescript-eslint/no-var-requires
const { composePlugins, withNx } = require('@nx/next');
const { join } = require('node:path');
 
/**
 * @type {import('@nx/next/plugins/with-nx').WithNxOptions}
 **/
const nextConfig = {
   nx: {
     // Set this to true if you would like to use SVGR
     // See: https://github.com/gregberge/svgr
     svgr: false,
   },
+   output: 'standalone',
+   experimental: {
+      // this should be the path to the root of your repo, in this case it's just two levels down. needed for open-next to detect that it's a monorepo
+     outputFileTracingRoot: join(__dirname, '../../'),
+   },
};
 
const plugins = [
   // Add more Next.js plugins to this list if needed.
   withNx,
];
 
module.exports = composePlugins(...plugins)(nextConfig);
```

3. Create `open-next.config.js` inside your apps root directory, it should look a little something like this: 
```javascript
import type { OpenNextConfig } from 'open-next/types/open-next';

const config = {
  default: {},
  buildCommand: 'exit 0', // in my example we set up Nx task distribution to handle the order of building.
  buildOutputPath: '.',
  appPath: '.',
  packageJsonPath: '../../', // again, path to the root of your repo (where the package.json is)
} satisfies OpenNextConfig;

export default config;
```

4. Set up nx's targets/tasks 

Now we have open-next configuration set up, you can try to run `open-next build` and depending on whether you have already built your next app or not
it might even work. 

However, we don't want to rely on needing to manually running a build every time we want to deploy a change, so instead we can set up a target.
We do this in your project's `project.json` (in this case, living at `apps/next-site/project`), we want to find the targets object and update it: 
```diff
{
  "name": "next-site",
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json",
  "sourceRoot": "apps/next-site",
  "projectType": "application",
  "tags": [],
  "targets": {
+    "open-next-build": { // name of the target, this is what you will call
+      "executor": "nx:run-commands", 
+      "dependsOn": ["build"], // this ensures that Nx will build our next app before running this command.
+      "cache": true, // cache the output, good for if you want to use DTE/Nx cloud
+      "outputs": ["{projectRoot}/.open-next"], // tell nx where the output lives
+      "options": {
+        "cwd": "apps/next-site", // where we run the command
+        "command": "open-next build" // what command we want to run
+      }
+    }
  }
}

```
Next we need to add the open-next directory to our eslint's `ignorePatterns` array 
```diff
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@nx/react-typescript",
    "next",
    "next/core-web-vitals",
    "../../.eslintrc.json"
  ],
  "ignorePatterns": [
    "!**/*",
+    ".next/**/*",
+    ".open-next/**/*"
  ],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["*.ts", "*.tsx", "*.js", "*.jsx"],
      "rules": {}
    },
    {
      "files": ["*.ts", "*.tsx"],
      "rules": {}
    },
    {
      "files": ["*.js", "*.jsx"],
      "rules": {}
    },
    {
      "files": ["*.spec.ts", "*.spec.tsx", "*.spec.js", "*.spec.jsx"],
      "env": {
        "jest": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

now, when you run `nx open-next-build next-site`, nx will automatically build the next app, and anything that the next app requires, neat!

5. Deploying with SST

Now, we have a built app, ready to deploy, so how do we get it onto SST/AWS ? Good question! 

We are using `sst ion` in this example. i will assume you have already have the cli installed, (if not, check here on how!)[https://ion.sst.dev/],
but we will not use the SST cli to init this project, because it wants to add a package.json to your next app, and it will look like it's working, but you will end up with a big far server error (all because the package.json overrides whatever nx _thinks_ there should be, and it will miss a bunch of dependencies). we will instead manually set this up:

- let's add the sst package with `pnpm add sst@ion`, and the required packages for SST to work with AWS `pnpm add --save-dev aws-cdk-lib constructs @types/aws-lambda`
- then we want to manually create an `sst.config.ts` file in `apps/next-site` that looks like this: 

```typescript
/// <reference path="./.sst/platform/config.d.ts" />

export default $config({
  app(input) {
    return {
      name: 'next-site', // use whatever your project is called here
      removal: input?.stage === 'production' ? 'retain' : 'remove',
      home: 'aws',
    };
  },
  async run() {
    new sst.aws.Nextjs('Site', {
      buildCommand: 'exit 0;' // again, we want to get Nx to handle building
    });
  },
});

```

- now, you probably see some type errors, as SST is not initialized yet, but we can resolve this by running
```bash
$ cd apps/next-site && sst install 
```

this will resolve the type issues and initialise SST.

- next we need to add `sst.config.ts` to our `tsconfig.json`'s excludes array

- then we want to add both `sst.config.ts` and the `.sst` folder to the eslint ignorePatterns

```diff
{
  "extends": [
    "plugin:@nx/react-typescript",
    "next",
    "next/core-web-vitals",
    "../../.eslintrc.json"
  ],
  "ignorePatterns": [
    "!**/*",
    ".next/**/*",
+    ".open-next/**/*",
+    ".sst/**/*",
+    "sst.config.ts"
  ],
  "overrides": [
    {
      "files": ["*.ts", "*.tsx", "*.js", "*.jsx"],
      "rules": {}
    },
    {
      "files": ["*.ts", "*.tsx"],
      "rules": {}
    },
    {
      "files": ["*.js", "*.jsx"],
      "rules": {}
    },
    {
      "files": ["*.spec.ts", "*.spec.tsx", "*.spec.js", "*.spec.jsx"],
      "env": {
        "jest": true
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

- now, if you want to run `sst dev` you can do so with `sst dev "nx dev next-site"` similarly deploying can be done with `sst deploy`...but you probably want to set up that task chaining, again we can do that by adding a target to your app, and setting it's `dependsOn` to the `open-next-build`, here's what it might look like: 

```diff
{
  "name": "next-site",
  "$schema": "../../node_modules/nx/schemas/project-schema.json",
  "sourceRoot": "apps/next-site",
  "projectType": "application",
  "tags": [],
  "targets": {
    "open-next-build": {
      "executor": "nx:run-commands", 
      "dependsOn": ["build"],
      "cache": true, 
      "outputs": ["{projectRoot}/.open-next"],
      "options": {
        "cwd": "apps/next-site",
        "command": "open-next build"
      }
+    },
+    "deploy": {
+      "executor": "nx:run-commands",
+      "dependsOn": ["open-next-build"],
+      "options": {
+        "cwd": "apps/next-site",
+        "command": "sst deploy --stage {args.stage}", // here we use nx's interpolation to allow --stage to be passed, with some configuration examples below
+        "forwardAllArgs": true
+      },
+      "defaultConfiguration": "dev",
+      "configurations": {
+        "production": {
+          "args": ["--stage=production"]
+        },
+        "staging": {
+          "args": ["--stage=staging"]
+        },
+        "dev": {
+          "args": ["--stage=development"] 
+        }
+      }
+    }
+  }
}


```

now we can run (or if you want a custom stage, you can simply do `nx deploy next-site --stage this-is-my-stage` and it will be passed directly to the sst command). 
```bash
$ nx deploy next-site --configuration dev # using dev configuration (which sets the stage to development)
# nx deploy next-site -c dev # OR
# nx deploy next-site --stage my-stage # Custom Stage 
```
