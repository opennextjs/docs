This override is used by OpenNext and more specifically by the image server to be able to load images from a custom source. Images are not bundled with the image server and are loaded from the source specified in the override.

This is used for internal image only (i.e. src without host). External source are already handled by the image server.

If you want to better understand how to implement your own ImageLoader, the easiest way would be to take a look at the existing [included ImageLoader](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/tree/main/packages/open-next/src/overrides/imageLoader).

## Included ImageLoader

### s3

The S3 ImageLoader will load images from an S3 bucket. It is used by default if you don't provide any ImageLoader in your configuration.
It uses the `@aws-sdk/client-s3` to interact with S3.

##### Requirements

- You need to provide the `BUCKET_KEY_PREFIX`, `BUCKET_NAME` environment variables to your server.

### s3-lite

The `s3-lite` ImageLoader will load images from an S3 bucket. It uses the `aws4fetch` to interact with S3.

##### Requirements

- You need to provide the `BUCKET_KEY_PREFIX`, `BUCKET_NAME` environment variables to your server. 
- Can also provide `BUCKET_REGION`. It fallbacks to `AWS_REGION` ?? `AWS_DEFAULT_REGION`. This should be set by AWS automatically. You can read more about how this works on AWS Lambdas [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-envvars.html#configuration-envvars-runtime).

### host

The Host ImageLoader will load images from the host.
This implementation will directly fetch the image from the host.

##### Requirements

The host should be provided in the headers of the request, either in the `X-Forwarded-Host` or the `Host` header.

### fs-dev

The FsDev ImageLoader is a simple implementation that loads images from the `.open-next/assets` folder and interact with it using the filesystem. It is useful for development purposes only.

### dummy

The Dummy ImageLoader is a dummy implementation that will throw an exception. It should not be used.
