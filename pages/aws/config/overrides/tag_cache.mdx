This override is used by the [`cache` adapter](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/blob/main/packages/open-next/src/adapters/cache.ts) that is provided by OpenNext to the NextServer. It is also used by OpenNext if `enableCacheInterception` is set to `true` in the configuration and by the `initializationFunction` for prepopulating the cache.

It is used for the cache tags (i.e. `revalidateTag` and `revalidatePath`). It does not handle anything related to the ISR/SSG cache or the fetch cache used by Next.js.
It's main role is to determine if a path is stale based on the tags and also to update the tag cache when `revalidateTag` is called.

The current implementation differs from the way Next.js standalone handle cache tags. In the standalone version, the cache tags are stored in a file, and every time a cache entry is accessed, it has to check for every tags if the entry is stale. This approach is very read heavy and doesn't work well with DB like DynamoDB.
We choose to go another way. We store tags for every path that exists in the cache. This way, we can easily know if a path is stale by just checking the path instead of every tags used. This approach is more write heavy but it's a tradeoff we are willing to make.
This also has the drawback of needing to prepopulate the cache with all the tags that are used in the application. This is done by the `initializationFunction`.

We might allow to choose how cache tags are handled in the future depending on the `TagCache` implementation. If you need this feature, feel free to open an issue on the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws).

If you want to better understand how to implement your own TagCache, the easiest way would be to take a look at the existing [included TagCache](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/tree/main/packages/open-next/src/overrides/tagCache).

## Included TagCache

### dynamodb

The DynamoDB TagCache will store the cache tags in a DynamoDB table. It is used by default if you don't provide any TagCache in your configuration.
It uses the `@aws-sdk/client-dynamodb` to interact with DynamoDB.

##### Requirements

- You need to provide the `CACHE_DYNAMO_TABLE`, `CACHE_BUCKET_REGION` environment variable to your server.
- DynamoDB table should have a primary key `path` of type `String` and a sort key `tag` of type `String`. (It can reuse the same table as the one used by the default `tagCache`)

### dynamodb-lite

The DynamoDBLite TagCache will store the cache tags in a DynamoDB table.
This implementation is a lighter version of the `dynamodb` TagCache as it uses `aws4fetch` to interact with DynamoDB.

##### Requirements

- You need to provide the `CACHE_DYNAMO_TABLE`, `CACHE_BUCKET_REGION`, `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`, `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` and `AWS_SESSION_TOKEN` environment variables to your server.
- DynamoDB table should have a primary key `path` of type `String` and a sort key `tag` of type `String`. (It can reuse the same table as the one used by the default `tagCache`)

### dynamodb-nextMode

TBA

### dummy

The Dummy TagCache is a dummy implementation that will throw an exception. It should not be used unless you want to disable cache tags.

### fs-dev

The FsDev TagCache is a simple implementation that stores the cache tags in a file in the `.open-next/cache` folder and interact with it using the filesystem. It is useful for development purposes only.
