This override is meant to convert request and response provided from your wrapper to the internal types that are used by OpenNext.

If you want to better understand how to implement your own Converter, the easiest way would be to take a look at one of the existing [included Converter](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/tree/main/packages/open-next/src/overrides/converters)

Couple of things to note :

- If you use a `StreamCreator` in your wrapper, you probably don't need to do anything in the `convertTo` function.
- If used for the default, the image optimization, or one of the splitted server the internal types will be `InternalEvent` and `InternalResult` respectively.
- If used for the external middleware, the internal types will be `InternalEvent` and `InternalResult | MiddlewareResult` respectively.
- For the other servers, look up their respective types in the codebase.
