Available since `@opennextjs/aws` 3.4.0

Not enabled by default. This override is used by OpenNext when routes have been On-Demand revalidated and the CDN needs to be updated. It is not called for ISR revalidation.
It will be called for `revalidatePath`, `revalidateTag` and `res.revalidate()`.

If you want to better understand how to implement your own Automatic CDN Invalidation, the easiest way would be to take a look at the existing [included Automatic CDN Invalidation](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/tree/main/packages/open-next/src/overrides/cdnInvalidation)

## Included Automatic CDN Invalidation

### dummy

The Dummy AutomaticCDNInvalidation is a dummy implementation that will do nothing. It is the default implementation.

### cloudfront

<Callout type='warning'>
Cloudfront invalidation can be very expensive. Manual CloudFront path invalidation incurs costs. According to the [AWS CloudFront pricing page](https://aws.amazon.com/cloudfront/pricing/):

> No additional charge for the first 1,000 paths requested for invalidation each month. Thereafter, $0.005 per path requested for invalidation.

This implementation will send an invalidation request for every route that needs to be invalidated (the request invalidates 2 paths, one for the route itself and one for the data route).

Tag cache invalidation could end up triggering thousands of invalidation requests.

Only use this implementation if you are aware of the costs and are willing to pay for it.

</Callout>

The CloudFront Automatic CDN Invalidation will invalidate the cache of the CloudFront distribution.

##### Requirements

- You need to provide the `CLOUDFRONT_DISTRIBUTION_ID` environment variable to your server.
