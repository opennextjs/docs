Available since `@opennextjs/aws` 3.7.0

This override is used by OpenNext to serve [static assets](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder) from the routing layer.

It is not enabled by default as the assumption is that assets are served before reaching the Open Next server.

When assets are not served before the Open Next server, you can create an Asset Resolver to serve them. It will be invoked [after the `beforeFiles` (`rewrites`) from `next.config.ts`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/middleware#execution-order).

## Implementation

An Asset Resolver should implement:

```ts
export interface AssetResolver {
  name: string;

  maybeGetAssetResult?: (event: InternalEvent) => Promise<InternalResult | undefined> | undefined;
}
```

`maybeGetAssetResult` is invoked with the `InternalEvent` and should return a `Promise<InternalResult>` to serve an asset when the incoming event matches one. When it returns `Promise<undefined>` or `undefined`, the routing process keeps going to try and match Next routes.

## Included Asset Resolver

### dummy

The dummy `AssetResolver` does nothing so it never serves assets. It is the default implementation.
