Here is a detailed example of an `open-next.config.ts` file. This file need to be at the same place as your `next.config.js` file

`server` in here could refer to a lambda function, a docker container, a node server or whatever that can support running nodejs code. Even Cloudflare workers (require to use `@opennextjs/cloudflare`).

For more information about the options here, take a look at the [reference section](/aws/config/reference).

```ts

    // for normal lambda as in open-next v2
    override: {
      // This is necessary to enable lambda streaming, defaults to aws-lambda
