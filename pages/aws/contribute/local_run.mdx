When making some changes to OpenNext, it can be a bit cumbersome to need to deploy every time you want to test changes. If your change is not dependent on the wrapper or the converter, then you can create a custom `open-next.config.ts` file (you can use another name so that it doesn't conflict with your existing `open-next.config.ts`).

To run `OpenNext` locally:

```bash
# This is to build (the config-path is needed if you use a different name than the default one)
node /path/to/opennextjs-aws/packages/open-next/dist/index.js build --config-path open-next.local.config.ts
# Then to run the server
node .open-next/server-functions/default/index.mjs
```

### open-next.local.config.ts

```typescript
// open-next.local.config.ts -
// A good practice would be to use a different name so that it doesn't conflict
// with your existing open-next.config.ts i.e. open-next.local.config.ts
// You could also customize it by using custom overrides if you need to.
import type { OpenNextConfig } from "@opennextjs/aws/types/open-next.js";

export default {
  default: {
    override: {
      wrapper: "express-dev",
      converter: "node",
      incrementalCache: "fs-dev",
      queue: "direct",
      tagCache: "fs-dev",
    },
  },

  imageOptimization: {
    override: {
      wrapper: "dummy",
      converter: "dummy",
    },
    loader: "fs-dev",
    // This part is not needed on arm linux, and image optimization will only work in linux
    install: {
      arch: "x64",
      packages: ["sharp"],
    },
  },

  // You can override the build command here so that you don't have to rebuild next every time you make a change
  //buildCommand: "echo 'No build command'",
} satisfies OpenNextConfig;

export default config;
```
