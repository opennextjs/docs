This page will list the release of Next.js that was tested at the time of the release of OpenNext.

<Callout variant="info">
  - Earlier versions of Next.js on the same major version should work just fine, if not, please open an [issue
  with a reproduction](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-aws/issues/new). - Later versions of Next.js
  on the same major version **usually** work, but there is no guarantee. - If you run versions of OpenNext on
  previous major versions of Next.js, we only aim to provide compatibility with the latest minor (and ideally
  patch) version of that major version. - No versions behind Next 12.3.4 is supported. - The main branch of
  `@opennextjs/aws` is always tested against the latest version of Next.js.
