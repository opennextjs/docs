  Streaming in AWS has been stable for a while now. There has been some trouble with AWS breaking the
  streaming functionality in the past. It seems to be working well now. If you have an issue with streaming
  send a message on [discord](https://discord.com/channels/1283128968140161065/1286094576788177059) and
  contact AWS support to let them know of the issue.

Streaming is using the new AWS lambda support for [streaming responses](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/configuration-response-streaming.html). This allows you to send data to the client as it's generated instead of waiting for the entire response to be generated.

If you want to try streaming you need to set the function url invoke mode to `RESPONSE_STREAM`.
You'll also need to add a `--streaming` tags to the build cli.

```bash
open-next build --streaming
```
