### AWS

---

OpenNext takes the Next.js build output and converts it into packages that can be deployed across a variety of environments.
Natively OpenNext has support for AWS Lambda, [Cloudflare](/cloudflare), and classic Node.js Server.

One notable feature of OpenNext is its ability to split the Next.js output, enabling selective deployment to different targets such as AWS Lambda, Cloudflare Workers, or Amazon ECS. This facilitates a tailored deployment strategy that aligns with the specific needs of your application.

Thanks to this, you could deploy part of your API to ECS, another part to Cloudflare Workers, your SSR routes to another ECS cluster, and your ISR/SSG routes to Lambda.

OpenNext AWS is currently maintained by the [SST](https://sst.dev) community; notably, [conico974](https://github.com/conico974) and [khuezy](https://github.com/khuezy).
