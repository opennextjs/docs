### Known issues

#### TS Config
- Your `tsconfig.json` must include the following setting:
  
  ```json
  "moduleResolution": "bundler"
  ```
  
  If this is not set, you may encounter issues during the build or runtime process.

- There is a known issue with ESM and the `open-next.config.ts` file. If you have an older project or one that depends on a specific TypeScript version or custom configuration, you may need to:
  - Reconfigure your project (for example, by setting `moduleResolution: bundler` as above), **or**
  - Add the following to your `tsconfig.json`:
    
    ```json
    "exclude": ["node_modules", "open-next.config.ts"]
    ```
  
  Whether this works depends on your project setup. In some cases, excluding `open-next.config.ts` allows the build to proceed, but you may still encounter errors, especially if your project uses features like `_app.mdx` or other advanced configurations. This is particularly relevant for projects that haven't been tested with these setups, and issues may also occur in other environments (such as the Cloudflare package).

#### Local Development

- Some applications may use Node.js or Web Standard APIs that are not fully supported by Azion's local development environment. However, these features might be available in the actual Azion runtime.

  If your application does not work as expected during local development, try deploying it to Azion before troubleshooting further, as it may work correctly in the deployed environment.
