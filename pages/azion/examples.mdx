## Examples

To create a new Next.js app for Azion, you can use the following starter projects and templates:

### Basic starter projects

- [Next.js + TypeScript + Tailwind Template](https://github.com/aziontech/azion-samples/tree/dev/templates/opennextjs/nextal-next-typescript-tailwind) — a ready-to-use template for building modern Next.js apps on Azion Edge Functions.
- [Node Playground (Next.js 13)](https://github.com/aziontech/bundler-examples/tree/main/examples/nextjs/node-playground-13) — an example showing how to run Next.js 13 in a Node.js environment on Azion.

You can use these repositories to understand how to configure your Next.js app to run on Azion, or as a starting point for your own projects.
