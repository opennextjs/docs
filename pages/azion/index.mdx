## Azion

The [`@aziontech/opennextjs-azion`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aziontech/opennextjs-azion) adapter lets you deploy Next.js apps to [Azion Edge Functions](https://www.azion.com/en/products/edge-functions/) using the [Node.js "runtime" from Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes).

### Get Started

##### New apps

To create a new Next.js app, pre-configured to run on Azion using `@aziontech/opennextjs-azion`, run:

```
npx create-next-app@14.2.4 my-next-app --use-npm && cd my-next-app && npm install @aziontech/opennextjs-azion@latest
```

##### Existing Next.js apps

Follow the guide [here](/azion/get-started) to use [@aziontech/opennextjs-azion](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@aziontech/opennextjs-azion) with an existing Next.js app.

### Supported Next.js versions

### Note on Edge Function Size Limits

Azion Edge Functions have a maximum size limit of 50 MiB per function. After building your project, pay attention to the compressed (gzipped) size of your deployment packageâ€”only the compressed size counts toward this limit.
For more details, see the [official Azion documentation on Edge Function size limits](https://www.azion.com/en/documentation/products/build/edge-application/edge-functions/#limits).
