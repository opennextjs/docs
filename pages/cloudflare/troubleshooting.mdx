## Troubleshooting

### Trying to deploy to Cloudflare Pages, instead of Cloudflare Workers?

`@opennextjs/cloudflare` is specifically built for deploying Next.js apps to [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)

Cloudflare Workers now support the majority of functionality from Cloudflare Pages, and have features that are not yet supported by Cloudflare Pages. Refer to the [Compatibility Matrix](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/compatibility-matrix/) in the Cloudflare Workers docs.

If you need to deploy to Cloudflare Pages, you can use `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`, and follow the [Cloudflare Pages guides for deploying Next.js apps](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/nextjs/).

### "Your Worker exceeded the size limit of 3 MiB"

The Cloudflare Account you are deploying to is on the Workers Free plan, which [limits the size of each Worker to 3 MiB](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/limits/#worker-size). When you subscribe to the Workers Paid plan, each Worker can be up to 10 MiB.

When deploying your Worker, `wrangler` will show both the original and compressed sizes. Only the latter (gzipped size) matters for these limits.

### "Your Worker exceeded the size limit of 10 MiB"

If your Worker is larger than 10 MiB compressed — there might be unnecessary code ending up in your production bundle. You can visualize and understand this by running:

1. `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build` within your project's root directory
2. `cd .open-next/server-functions/default` to open the directory that contains the bundled code
3. Take the file named `handler.mjs.meta.json` and use the [ESBuild Bundle Analyzer](https://esbuild.github.io/analyze/) to visualize your application's code, and understand the largest parts of your production bundle

### My app fails to build when I import a specific NPM package

First, make sure that the `nodejs_compat` compatibility flag is enabled, and your compatibility date is set to on or after "2024-09-23", in your [wrangler configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).
Refer to the [Node.js Workers docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) for more details on Node.js support in Cloudflare Workers.

Some NPM packages define multiple exports. For example:

```
"exports": {
    "other": "./src/other.js",
    "node": "./src/node.js",
    "browser": "./src/browser.js",
    "default": "./src/default.js"
},
```

When you use `@opennextjs/cloudflare`, [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/) bundles your code before running it locally, or deploying it to Cloudflare. Wrangler has to choose which export to use, when you import a module. By default, Wrangler, which uses [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), handles this in a way that is not compatible with some NPM packages.

You may want to modify how Wrangler resolves multiple exports, such that when you import packages, the `node` export, if present, is used. You can do do by defining the following variables in a `.env` file within the root directory of your Next.js app:

```
WRANGLER_BUILD_CONDITIONS=""
WRANGLER_BUILD_PLATFORM="node"
```

### `Error: Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request.`

Some DB clients (i.e. [`postgres`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/postgres)) create a connection to the DB server when they are first instantiated and re-use it for later requests.
This programming model is not compatible with the Workers runtime where a connection can not be re-used in a different request.

The following error is generated in such a case:

```text
⨯ Error: Cannot perform I/O on behalf of a different request. I/O objects (such as streams, request/response bodies, and others) created in the context of one request handler cannot be accessed from a different request's handler. This is a limitation of Cloudflare Workers which allows us to improve overall performance. (I/O type: Writable)
```

To solve this, you should create the DB client inside a request context and not keep a global DB client.

A global client would not work:

```ts
// src/lib/db.ts
import postgres from "postgres";

// `client` is global.
// As the connection would be shared across requests, it fails on worker
export const client = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { max: 5 });

// src/app/api/route.ts
import { client } from "@/db/db";

export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";

export async function GET() {
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(await client`SELECT * FROM users;`));
}
```

It can fixed by creating the client for each incoming request:

```ts
// src/app/api/route.ts
export const dynamic = "force-dynamic";

export async function GET() {
  // The client is created for each incoming request and no connection is shared across requests
  const client = postgres(process.env.DATABASE_URL, { max: 5 });
  return new Response(JSON.stringify(await client`SELECT * FROM users;`));
}
```

### `Error: Failed to load chunk server/chunks/ssr/<chunk_name>.js`

If you see an error similar to:

```text
✘ [ERROR] ⨯ Error: Failed to load chunk server/chunks/ssr/<chunk_name>.js

      at loadChunkPath
  (...)
      at Object.loadChunk
  (...)
      at .open-next/server-functions/default/.next/server/app/page.js
```

You are proably using a turbopack enabled build (`next build --turbo`) which is not currently supported by OpenNext.
Change your build command to `next build` to fix the issue.

### `X [ERROR] Could not resolve "<package>"`

When you see the following error during the build:

```text
⚙️ Bundling the OpenNext server...

X [ERROR] Could not resolve "<package name>"
```

It might be because the package contains workerd specific code.
