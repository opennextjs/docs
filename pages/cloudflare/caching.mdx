## Caching

`@opennextjs/cloudflare` supports [caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#caching-data).

### How to enable caching

`@opennextjs/cloudflare` supports multiple caching mechanisms through a project's OpenNext configuration.

#### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

There are two storage options to use for the incremental cache.

- **Workers KV:** A [fast](https://blog.cloudflare.com/faster-workers-kv) and uses Cloudflare's [Tiered Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/) to increase cache hit rates. When you write cached data to Workers KV, you write to storage that can be read by any Cloudflare location. This means your app can fetch data, cache it in KV, and then subsequent requests anywhere around the world can read from this cache. The build time values are serverd by the [Workers Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/). Pricing information can be found in the Cloudflare [docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/platform/pricing/#workers-kv).
- **R2 Object Storage:** A [cost-effective](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/) S3-compatible object storage option for large amounts of unstructured data. Data is stored in a single region, meaning cache interactions may be slower - this can be mitigated with a regional cache.

<Callout>
  Workers KV is eventually consistent, which means that it can take up to 60 seconds for updates to be
  reflected globally, when using the default TTL of 60 seconds.
</Callout>

<Tabs items={["Workers KV", "R2 Object Storage"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
##### 1. Create a KV namespace

```
npx wrangler@latest kv namespace create <YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME>
```

##### 2. Add the KV namespace and Service Binding to your Worker

The binding name used in your app's worker is `NEXT_INC_CACHE_KV`.
The `WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE` service binding should be a self reference to your worker where `<WORKER_NAME>` is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ...
  "name": "<WORKER_NAME>",
  "kv_namespaces": [
    {
      "binding": "NEXT_INC_CACHE_KV",
      "id": "<BINDING_ID>",
    },
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
      "service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
    },
  ],
}
```

##### 3. Configure the cache

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the KV cache.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import kvIncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/kv-incremental-cache";
// ...

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: kvIncrementalCache,
  // ...
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

##### 1. Create an R2 Bucket

```
npx wrangler@latest r2 bucket create <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>
```

##### 2. Add the R2 Bucket and Service Binding to your Worker

The binding name used in your app's worker is `NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET`. The service binding should be a self reference to your worker where `<WORKER_NAME>` is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

The prefix used by the R2 bucket can be configured with the `NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_PREFIX` environment variable, and defaults to `incremental-cache`.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ...
  "name": "<WORKER_NAME>",
  "r2_buckets": [
    {
      "binding": "NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET",
      "bucket_name": "<BUCKET_NAME>",
      "preview_bucket_name": "<PREVIEW_BUCKET_NAME>",
    },
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
      "service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
    },
  ],
}
```

##### 3. Configure the cache

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the R2 cache.

You can optionally setup a regional cache to use with the R2 incremental cache. This will enable faster retrieval of cache entries and reduce the amount of requests being sent to object storage.

The regional cache has two modes:

- `short-lived`: Responses are re-used for up to a minute.
- `long-lived`: Fetch responses are re-used until revalidated, and ISR/SSG responses are re-used for up to 30 minutes.

Additionally, lazy updating of the regional cache can be enabled with the `shouldLazilyUpdateOnCacheHit` option. When requesting data from the cache, it sends a background request to the R2 bucket to get the latest entry. This is enabled by default for the `long-lived` mode.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import { withRegionalCache } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/regional-cache";
// ...

// With regional cache enabled:
export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: withRegionalCache(r2IncrementalCache, {
    mode: "long-lived",
    shouldLazilyUpdateOnCacheHit: true,
  }),
  // ...
});

// Without regional cache:
export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: r2IncrementalCache,
  // ...
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

##### 4. Configure the queue

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the cache and set up a queue.

The Durable Object Queue will send revalidation requests to a page when needed, and offers support for de-duplicating requests.
By default there will be a maximum of 10 instance of the Durables Object Queue and they can each process up to 5 requests in parallel, for up to 50 concurrent ISR revalidations.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
// ...
import doQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  // ...
  queue: doQueue,
});
```

You will also need to add some binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file.

```jsonc
"durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "name": "NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE",
        "class_name": "DurableObjectQueueHandler"
      }
    ]
  },
  "migrations": [
    {
      "tag": "v1",
      "new_sqlite_classes": ["DurableObjectQueueHandler"]
    }
  ],
```

You can customize the behaviors of the queue with environment variables:

- The max number of revalidations that can be processed by an instance of durable object at the same time (`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_MAX_REVALIDATION`)
- The max time in milliseconds that a revalidation can take before being considered as failed (`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- The amount of time after which a revalidation will be attempted again if it failed. If it fails again it will exponentially back off until it reaches the max retry interval (`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`)
- The maximum number of attempts that can be made to revalidate a path (`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_MAX_NUM_REVALIDATIONS`)
- Disable SQLite for this durable object. It should only be used if your incremental cache is not eventually consistent (`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_DISABLE_SQLITE`)

<Callout>
  There is 2 additional modes that you can use for the queue `direct` and the memory queue

- The memory queue will dedupe request but only on a per isolate basis. It is not fully suitable for production deployments, you
  can use it at your own risk!

- The `direct` mode for the queue is intended for debugging purposes and is not recommended for use in
  production. It only works in preview mode (i.e. `wrangler dev`)

  For apps using the Page Router, `res.revalidate` requires to provide a self reference service binding named `WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE`.

</Callout>

#### On-Demand Revalidation

The tag revalidation mechanism can use either a [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) database or [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) with `SqliteStorage` as its backing store for information about tags, paths, and revalidation times.

To use on-demand revalidation, you should also follow the [ISR setup steps](#incremental-static-regeneration-isr).

<Callout>
  If your app **only** uses the pages router, it does not need to have a tag cache and should skip this step.
  You can also skip this step if your app doesn't to use `revalidateTag` nor `revalidatePath`.
</Callout>

There are 3 different options to choose from for the tag cache: `d1NextTagCache`, `doShardedTagCache` and `d1TagCache`.
Which one to choose should be based on two key factors:

1. **Expected Load**: Consider the volume of traffic or data you anticipate.
2. **Usage of** `revalidateTag` / `revalidatePath`: Evaluate how frequently these features will be utilized.

If either of these factors is significant, opting for a sharded database is recommended. Additionally, incorporating a regional cache can further enhance performance.

<Tabs items={["D1NextTagCache", "doShardedTagCache", "D1TagCache"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>
##### 1. Create a D1 database and Service Binding

The binding name used in your app's worker is `NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1`. The `WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE` service binding should be a self reference to your worker where `<WORKER_NAME>` is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ...
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1",
      "database_id": "<DATABASE_ID>",
      "database_name": "<DATABASE_NAME>",
    },
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
      "service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
    },
  ],
}
```

##### 2. Create table for tag revalidations

The D1 tag cache requires a `revalidations` table that tracks On-Demand revalidation times.

##### 3. Configure the cache

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the KV cache and set up a queue (see above). The queue will send a revalidation request to a page when needed, but it will not dedupe requests.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import kvIncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/kv-cache";
import d1NextTagCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/d1-next-tag-cache";
import memoryQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/memory-queue";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: kvIncrementalCache,
  tagCache: d1NextTagCache,
  queue: memoryQueue,
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>
##### 1. Create a Durable Object and Service Binding
The service binding should be a self reference to your worker where `<WORKER_NAME>` is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ...
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "name": "NEXT_CACHE_REVALIDATION_DURABLE_OBJECT",
        "class_name": "DurableObjectQueueHandler",
      },
      {
        "name": "NEXT_CACHE_DO_SHARDED",
        "class_name": "DOShardedTagCache",
      },
    ],
  },
  "migrations": [
    {
      "tag": "v1",
      "new_sqlite_classes": ["DurableObjectQueueHandler", "DOShardedTagCache"],
    },
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
      "service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
    },
  ],
}
```

##### 2. Configure the cache

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the KV cache and set up a queue. The queue will send a revalidation request to a page when needed, but it will not dedupe requests.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import kvIncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/kv-incremental-cache";
import memoryQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";
import doShardedTagCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/tag-cache/do-sharded-tag-cache";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: kvIncrementalCache,
  tagCache: doShardedTagCache({ baseShardSize: 12, regionalCache: true }),
  queue: memoryQueue,
});
```

doShardedTagCache tahes the following options:

- `baseShardSize` - The number of shards to use for the cache. The more shards you have, the more evenly the cache will be distributed across the shards. The default is 4. Soft (internal next tags used for `revalidatePath`) and hard tags (the one you define in your app) will be split in different shards
- `regionalCache` - Whether to use regional cache for the cache. The default is false. This option is useful when you want to reduce the stress on the durable object
- `regionalCacheTtlSec` - The TTL for the regional cache. The default is 5 seconds. Increasing this value will increase the time it takes for the cache to be invalidated across regions
- `enableShardReplication`: Enable replicating the Shard. Shard replication will duplicate each shards into replicas to spread the load even more
- `shardReplicationOptions.numberOfSoftReplicas`: Number of replicas for the soft tag shards
- `shardReplicationOptions.numberOfHardReplicas`: Number of replicas for the hard tag shards
- `maxWriteRetries`: The number of retries to perform when writing tags

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

<Callout>
  The `d1TagCache` is not recommended for production use, as it does not scale well with the number of tags.
</Callout>

##### 1. Create a D1 database and Service Binding

The binding name used in your app's worker is `NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1`. The service binding should be a self reference to your worker where `<WORKER_NAME>` is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ...
  "name": "<WORKER_NAME>",
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1",
      "database_id": "<DATABASE_ID>",
      "database_name": "<DATABASE_NAME>",
    },
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
      "service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
    },
  ],
}
```

The D1 database uses two tables, created when initialising the cache:

- the "tags" table keeps a record of the tag/path mappings
- the "revalidations" table tracks revalidation times

##### 2. Configure the cache

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the KV cache and set up a queue. The queue will send a revalidation request to a page when needed, but it will not dedupe requests.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import kvIncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/kv-incremental-cache";
import d1TagCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/tag-cache/d1-tag-cache";
import memoryQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/memory-queue";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: kvIncrementalCache,
  tagCache: d1TagCache,
  queue: memoryQueue,
});
```

##### 3. Initialise the cache during deployments

In order for the cache to be properly initialised with the build-time revalidation data, you need to run a command as part of your deploy step. This should be run as part of each deployment to ensure that the cache is being populated with each build's data.

To populate remote bindings and deploy your application at the same time, you can use the `deploy` command. Similarly, the `preview` command will populate your local bindings and start a Wrangler dev server.

```sh
# Populate remote and deploy.
opennextjs-cloudflare deploy

# Populate local and start dev server.
opennextjs-cloudflare preview
```

It is possible to only populate the cache without any other steps with the `populateCache` command.

```sh
# The target is passed as an option, either `local` or `remote`.
opennextjs-cloudflare populateCache local
```
