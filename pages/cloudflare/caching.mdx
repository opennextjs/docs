## Caching

Next.js offers multiple ways to improve an application's performance by [caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#caching-data) routes and network requests. An application will try to pre-render and cache as much data as possible during build-time to reduce the amount of work required when serving a response to a user.

The cache data are updated using revalidation, either peridiocally or on-demand:

- "[Time-based revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#time-based-revalidation)" updates the cache data after the revalidation delay specified by the applications expires
- "[On-demand revalidation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration#on-demand-revalidation-with-revalidatetag)" allows to invalid cache entries with a specific tag (via `revalidateTag`) or at a given path (via `revalidatePath`). You can also use `res.revalidate` in Pages router API route.

The `@opennextjs/cloudflare` caching supports rely on 3 components:

- An **Incremental Cache** to store the cache data
- A **Queue** to synchronize and deduplicate time-based revalidations
- A **Tag Cache** for On-demand revalidations via [`revalidateTag`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidateTag) and [`revalidatePath`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/functions/revalidatePath).

You can also enable cache interception, to avoid calling the `NextServer` and thus loading the javascript associated with the page. It can slightly improve cold start performance for ISR/SSG route on cached routes.
As of now, cache interception does not work with PPR and is not enabled by default.

Additionally some components uses the [Cache Api](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/cache/) to improve the performance of these different components.
If you're planning on using On-Demand revalidation, you should also use the [Cache Purge component](#automatic-cache-purge) to automatically purge the cache when a page is revalidated.

The adapter provides several implementations for each of those components configured in `open-next.config.ts`.

This guide provides guidelines for common use cases before detailing all the configuration options.

<Callout type="info">
  Everything in this page only concerns SSG/ISR and the data cache, SSR route will work out of the box without
  any caching config.
</Callout>

### Guidelines

#### Small site using revalidation

You should use the following implementation for a small site:

- Incremental Cache: use R2 to store the data
- Queue: use a Queue backed by Durable Objects
- Tag Cache: `D1NextModeTagCache`

#### Large site using revalidation

For a larger site, you should use the `ShardedDOTagCache` that can handle a higher load than the `D1NextModeTagCache`:

  cachePurge: purgeCache({ type: "direct" }),
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### SSG site

If your site is static, you do not need a Queue nor a Tag Cache. You can use a read-only Workers Static Assets-based incremental cache for the prerendered routes.

<Tabs items={["open-next.config.ts"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

```ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import staticAssetsIncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/static-assets-incremental-cache";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: staticAssetsIncrementalCache,
  enableCacheInterception: true,
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Staging

For staging, when your site receives low traffic from a single IP, you can replace the DO queue with a memory queue.

### References

#### Static Assets Caching

<Callout type="info">
  The worker doesn't run **in front** of static assets, so the `headers` option of `next.config.ts` doesn't
  apply to public files (`public`) and immutable build files (like `_next/static`).
</Callout>

By default, Cloudflare [Static Assets headers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/headers/#default-headers) use `max-age=0` with `must-revalidate`, allowing the browser to cache assets but with a revalidation request. This is the [same default behavior as the `public` folder on Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/public-folder#caching).

Next.js also generates _immutable_ files that don't change between builds. Those files will also be served from Static Assets. To match the [default cache behavior of immutable assets in Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/guides/self-hosting#automatic-caching), avoiding unnecessary revalidation requests, add the following header to the [`public/_headers`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/headers/#custom-headers) file:

```txt
/_next/static/*
  Cache-Control: public,max-age=31536000,immutable
```

#### Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)

There are 3 storage options for the incremental cache:

- **R2 Object Storage:** A [cost-effective](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/pricing/) S3-compatible object storage option for large amounts of unstructured data. Data is stored in a single region, meaning cache interactions may be slower - this can be mitigated with a regional cache.
- **Workers KV:** A [fast](https://blog.cloudflare.com/faster-workers-kv) key value store, it uses Cloudflare's [Tiered Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/) to increase cache hit rates. When you write cached data to Workers KV, you write to storage that can be read by any Cloudflare location. This means your app can fetch data, cache it in KV, and then subsequent requests anywhere around the world can read from this cache.
- **Workers Static Assets:** A read-only store for the incremental cache, serving build-time values from [Workers Static Assets](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/). Revalidation is not supported with this cache.

<Tabs items={["R2 Object Storage", "Workers KV", "Workers Static Assets"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

##### 1. Create an R2 Bucket

```sh
npx wrangler@latest r2 bucket create <YOUR_BUCKET_NAME>
```

##### 2. Add the R2 Bucket and Service Binding to your Worker

The binding name used in your app's worker is `NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET`. The service binding should be a self reference to your worker where `<WORKER_NAME>` is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

The prefix used by the R2 bucket can be configured with the `NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_PREFIX` environment variable, and defaults to `incremental-cache`.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ...
  "name": "<WORKER_NAME>",
  "r2_buckets": [
    {
      "binding": "NEXT_INC_CACHE_R2_BUCKET",
      "bucket_name": "<BUCKET_NAME>",
    },
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
      "service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
    },
  ],
}
```

##### 3. Configure the cache

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the R2 cache.

You can optionally setup a regional cache to use with the R2 incremental cache. This will enable faster retrieval of cache entries and reduce the amount of requests being sent to object storage.

The regional cache has two modes:

- `short-lived`: Responses are re-used for up to a minute.
- `long-lived`: Fetch responses are re-used until revalidated, and ISR/SSG responses are re-used for up to 30 minutes.

Additionally, lazy updating of the regional cache can be enabled with the `shouldLazilyUpdateOnCacheHit` option. When requesting data from the cache, it sends a background request to the R2 bucket to get the latest entry. This is enabled by default for the `long-lived` mode.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import { withRegionalCache } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/regional-cache";
// ...

// With regional cache enabled:
export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: withRegionalCache(r2IncrementalCache, {
    mode: "long-lived",
    shouldLazilyUpdateOnCacheHit: true,
  }),
  // ...
});

// Without regional cache:
export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: r2IncrementalCache,
  // ...
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

<Callout>
  Workers KV is eventually consistent, which means that it can take up to 60 seconds for updates to be
  reflected globally, when using the default TTL of 60 seconds.
</Callout>

**Create a KV namespace**

```sh
npx wrangler@latest kv namespace create <YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME>
```

**Add the KV namespace and Service Binding to your Worker**

The binding name used in your app's worker is `NEXT_INC_CACHE_KV`.
The `WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE` service binding should be a self reference to your worker where `<WORKER_NAME>` is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

The prefix used by the cache keys can be configured with the `NEXT_INC_CACHE_KV_PREFIX` environment variable, and defaults to `incremental-cache`.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ...
  "name": "<WORKER_NAME>",
  "kv_namespaces": [
    {
      "binding": "NEXT_INC_CACHE_KV",
      "id": "<BINDING_ID>",
    },
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
      "service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
    },
  ],
}
```

**Configure the cache**

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the KV cache.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import kvIncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/kv-incremental-cache";
// ...

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: kvIncrementalCache,
  // ...
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>

<Tabs.Tab>

<Callout>
  The Workers Static Assets cache is read-only. Requests that attempt to modify it will be ignored.
</Callout>

**Configure the cache**

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the static assets cache.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import staticAssetsIncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/static-assets-incremental-cache";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: staticAssetsIncrementalCache,
});
```

</Tabs.Tab>
</Tabs>

#### Queue

A queue must be setup for projects using revalidation (either Time based or On-demand).

**Configure the queue**

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the cache and set up a queue.

The Durable Object Queue will send revalidation requests to a page when needed, and offers support for de-duplicating requests.
By default there will be a maximum of 10 instance of the Durables Object Queue and they can each process up to 5 requests in parallel, for up to 50 concurrent ISR revalidations.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
// ...
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import doQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  // ...
  incrementalCache: r2IncrementalCache,
  queue: doQueue,
});
```

You will also need to add some binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file.

```jsonc
"durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "name": "NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE",
        "class_name": "DOQueueHandler"
      }
    ]
  },
  "migrations": [
    {
      "tag": "v1",
      "new_sqlite_classes": ["DOQueueHandler"]
    }
  ],
```

You can customize the behaviors of the queue with environment variables:

- The max number of revalidations that can be processed by an instance of durable object at the same time (`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_MAX_RETRIES`)
- The max time in milliseconds that a revalidation can take before being considered as failed (`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_REVALIDATION_TIMEOUT_MS`)
- The amount of time after which a revalidation will be attempted again if it failed. If it fails again it will exponentially back off until it reaches the max retry interval (`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_RETRY_INTERVAL_MS`)
- The maximum number of attempts that can be made to revalidate a path (`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_MAX_RETRIES`)
- Disable SQLite for this durable object. It should only be used if your incremental cache is not eventually consistent (`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_DISABLE_SQLITE`)

<Callout>
  There is 2 additional modes that you can use for the queue `direct` and the memory queue

- The memory queue will dedupe request but only on a per isolate basis. It is not fully suitable for production deployments, you
  can use it at your own risk!

- The `direct` mode for the queue is intended for debugging purposes and is not recommended for use in
  production. It only works in preview mode (i.e. `wrangler dev`)

  For apps using the Page Router, `res.revalidate` requires to provide a self reference service binding named `WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE`.

</Callout>

In certain situations, you may encounter the limits of what the Durable Object queue can manage for a single page or route. In such cases, you can utilize the queueCache to minimize the number of stale requests sent to the queue. This is achieved by adding and verifying a cache entry via the Cache API before dispatching a request to the queue. If a cache entry already exists, the request will not be sent to the queue, as it will be considered already in process.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
// ...
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import doQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";
import queueCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/queue-cache";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  // ...
  incrementalCache: r2IncrementalCache,
  queue: queueCache(doQueue, {
    regionalCacheTtlSec: 5, // The TTL for the regional cache, defaults to 5 seconds

    // Whether to wait for the queue to acknowledge the request before returning
    // When set to false, the cache will be populated asap and the queue will be called after.
    // When set to true, the cache will be populated only after the queue ack is received.
    waitForQueueAck: true,
  }),
});
```

#### Tag Cache for On-Demand Revalidation

The tag revalidation mechanism can use either a [Cloudflare D1](https://developers.cloudflare.com/d1/) database or [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/durable-objects/) with `SqliteStorage` as its backing store for information about tags, paths, and revalidation times.

To use on-demand revalidation, you should also follow the [ISR setup steps](#incremental-static-regeneration-isr).

<Callout>
  If your app **only** uses the pages router, it does not need to have a tag cache and should skip this step.
  You can also skip this step if your app doesn't use `revalidateTag` nor `revalidatePath`.
</Callout>

There are 2 different options to choose from for the tag cache: `d1NextTagCache`, `doShardedTagCache`.
Which one to choose should be based on two key factors:

1. **Expected Load**: Consider the volume of traffic or data you anticipate.
2. **Usage of** `revalidateTag` / `revalidatePath`: Evaluate how frequently these features will be utilized.

If either of these factors is significant, opting for a sharded database is recommended. Additionally, incorporating a regional cache can further enhance performance.

<Tabs items={["D1NextTagCache", "doShardedTagCache", "withFilter"]}>
<Tabs.Tab>

**Create a D1 database and Service Binding**

The binding name used in your app's worker is `NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1`. The `WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE` service binding should be a self reference to your worker where `<WORKER_NAME>` is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ...
  "d1_databases": [
    {
      "binding": "NEXT_TAG_CACHE_D1",
      "database_id": "<DATABASE_ID>",
      "database_name": "<DATABASE_NAME>",
    },
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
      "service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
    },
  ],
}
```

**Create table for tag revalidations**

The D1 tag cache requires a `revalidations` table that tracks On-Demand revalidation times.

**Configure the cache**

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the R2 cache and set up a queue (see above). The queue will send a revalidation request to a page when needed, but it will not dedupe requests.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import doQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";
import d1NextTagCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/tag-cache/d1-next-tag-cache";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: r2IncrementalCache,
  queue: doQueue,
  tagCache: d1NextTagCache,
});
```

##### 4. Initialise the cache during deployments

In order for the cache to be properly initialised with the build-time revalidation data, you need to run a command as part of your deploy step. This should be run as part of each deployment to ensure that the cache is being populated with each build's data.

To populate remote bindings and create a new [version](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/#versions) of your application at the same time, you can use either the `deploy` command or the `upload` command. Similarly, the `preview` command will populate your local bindings and start a Wrangler dev server.

```sh
# Populate remote and deploy the worker immediately.
opennextjs-cloudflare deploy

# Populate remote and upload a new version of the worker.
opennextjs-cloudflare upload

# Populate local and start dev server.
opennextjs-cloudflare preview
```

It is possible to only populate the cache without any other steps with the `populateCache` command.

```sh
# The target is passed as an option, either `local` or `remote`.
opennextjs-cloudflare populateCache local
```

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>

**Create a Durable Object and Service Binding**

The service binding should be a self reference to your worker where `<WORKER_NAME>` is the name in your wrangler configuration file.

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  // ...
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "name": "NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE",
        "class_name": "DOQueueHandler",
      },
      {
        "name": "NEXT_TAG_CACHE_DO_SHARDED",
        "class_name": "DOShardedTagCache",
      },
    ],
  },
  "migrations": [
    {
      "tag": "v1",
      "new_sqlite_classes": ["DOQueueHandler", "DOShardedTagCache"],
    },
  ],
  "services": [
    {
      "binding": "WORKER_SELF_REFERENCE",
      "service": "<WORKER_NAME>",
    },
  ],
}
```

**Configure the cache**

In your project's OpenNext config, enable the R2 cache and set up a queue.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import doQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";
import doShardedTagCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/tag-cache/do-sharded-tag-cache";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: r2IncrementalCache,
  tagCache: doShardedTagCache({ baseShardSize: 12, regionalCache: true }),
  queue: doQueue,
});
```

doShardedTagCache takes the following options:

- `baseShardSize`: The number of shards to use for the cache. The more shards you have, the more evenly the cache will be distributed across the shards. The default is 4. Soft (internal next tags used for `revalidatePath`) and hard tags (the ones you define in your app) will be split in different shards
- `regionalCache`: Whether to use regional cache for the cache. The default is false. This option is useful when you want to reduce the stress on the durable object
- `regionalCacheTtlSec`: The TTL for the regional cache. The default is 5 seconds. Increasing this value will increase the time it takes for the cache to be invalidated across regions
- `shardReplication`: Enable replicating the Shard. Shard replication will duplicate each shards into replicas to spread the load even more
  - `numberOfSoftReplicas`: Number of replicas for the soft tag shards
  - `numberOfHardReplicas`: Number of replicas for the hard tag shards
  - `regionalReplicationOptions` : This setting enables you to replicate shards across different regions, thereby reducing read latency and distributing the load more evenly. By enabling this option, each shard will be replicated in all available regions. Please note that this will increase the number of Durable Objects (DOs) created and the volume of write requests sent to the DOs.
    - `defaultRegion`: The default region to use for the replication.
- `maxWriteRetries`: The number of retries to perform when writing tags

</Tabs.Tab>
<Tabs.Tab>
<Callout>
  The `withFilter` option is a specialized configuration that enhances your `tagCache` by layering an additional filter. It requires another tag cache to be passed in as the tagCache (e.g., `d1NextTagCache`, `doShardedTagCache` or your own).
</Callout>
This enhanced tag cache selectively filters which tags trigger revalidations, allowing you to focus on a specific subset and reduce unnecessary load on the underlying tag cache. For convenience, we provide the ready-to-use `softTagFilter` that automatically filters out tags used by the `revalidatePath` function making it a no-op.

Its primary purpose is to filter out soft tags (i.e., those used by `revalidatePath`) from the tag cache, which are not relevant for your application. It could also be used to filter out hard tags (i.e., those you define in your app) if one of your dependencies uses them.

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";

    tagCache: d1NextTagCache,
    filterFn: softTagFilter,
  }),
});
```

You can also create your own custom filter function. This function must return a boolean value indicating whether a tag should be included. It will be invoked with a single tag (as a string) as its argument. Please note that "soft tags" (i.e., those used by revalidatePath) always start with the prefix `_N_T`.

#### Automatic Cache Purge

<Callout>

You can only enable cache purge functionality on a zone (e.g., when using a custom domain).

</Callout>

The cache purge component automatically clears the cache when a page is revalidated. It is only necessary if you use On-Demand revalidation along with one of the cache components that leverage the Cache API.

This component can either call the Cache API's purge function directly or route the purge request through an intermediate durable object. Using a durable object helps buffer requests and avoid reaching [API rate limits] (https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/purge-cache/#hostname-tag-prefix-url-and-purge-everything-limits).

Cache purge are only called when you call `revalidateTag`, `revalidatePath` or `res.revalidate` in the pages router. It is not called for ISR revalidation.

Below is an example configuration for integrating the cache purge component in your `open-next.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineCloudflareConfig } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
import r2IncrementalCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/r2-incremental-cache";
import { withRegionalCache } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/incremental-cache/regional-cache";
import doShardedTagCache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/tag-cache/do-sharded-tag-cache";
import doQueue from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/queue/do-queue";
import { purgeCache } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/overrides/cache-purge/index";

export default defineCloudflareConfig({
  incrementalCache: withRegionalCache(r2IncrementalCache, { mode: "long-lived" }),
  queue: doQueue,
  // This is only required if you use On-demand revalidation
  tagCache: doShardedTagCache({ baseShardSize: 12 }),
  // Disable this if you want to use PPR
  enableCacheInterception: true,
  // you can also use the `durableObject` option to use a durable object as a cache purge
  cachePurge: purgeCache({ type: "direct" }),
});
```

If you want to use the durable object option, you will need to add the following binding to your `wrangler.jsonc` file:

```jsonc
{
  "durable_objects": {
    "bindings": [
      {
        "name": "NEXT_CACHE_DO_PURGE",
        "class_name": "BucketCachePurge",
      },
    ],
  },
  "migrations": [
    {
      "tag": "v1",
      "new_sqlite_classes": ["BucketCachePurge"],
    },
  ],
}
```

You can customize the duration of the cache purge buffering with the `NEXT_CACHE_DO_PURGE_BUFFER_TIME_IN_SECONDS` environment variable. The default is 5 seconds. It works by buffering the purge requests for a given amount of time and then sending them all at once. This is useful to avoid hitting the API rate limits.
