### Migrate from 0.2 to 0.3

The `@opennextjs/cloudflare` adapter is now more closely intgrated with `@opennextjs/aws`.

You will need to update your projects based on the 0.2 release as described in the following sections.

##### 1. Update the `wrangler.toml` file

The entry point is now `.open-next/worker.js`, update `wrangler.toml` accordingly:

```toml
# CHANGED: new entry point location
main = ".open-next/worker.js"
name = "my-app"

compatibility_date = "2024-09-23"
compatibility_flags = ["nodejs_compat"]

# The binding name must be "ASSETS" when the cache is enabled
# CHANGED: output folder location
assets = { directory = ".open-next/assets", binding = "ASSETS" }
```

##### 2. Add a `open-next.config.ts` file

Add a [`open-next.config.ts`](https://opennext.js.org/aws/config) file to the root directory of your Next.js app:

```ts
import type { OpenNextConfig } from "@opennextjs/aws/types/open-next.js";
import cache from "@opennextjs/cloudflare/kvCache";

const config: OpenNextConfig = {
  default: {
    override: {
      wrapper: "cloudflare-node",
      converter: "edge",
      // Set `incrementalCache` to "dummy" to disable KV cache
      incrementalCache: async () => cache,
      tagCache: "dummy",
      queue: "dummy",
    },
  },

  middleware: {
    external: true,
    override: {
      wrapper: "cloudflare-edge",
      converter: "edge",
      proxyExternalRequest: "fetch",
    },
  },
};

export default config;
```

You can either install the `@opennextjs/aws` NPM package to get the types or `open-next.config.ts` to the [`exclude`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig/#exclude) configuration key of your `tsconfig.json`.

##### 3. Add a `.dev.vars` file

Add a [`.dev.vars`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/testing/local-development/#local-only-environment-variables) file to the root directory of your Next.js app:

```text
NEXTJS_ENV=development
```

The `NEXTJS_ENV` variable defines the environment to use when loading Next.js `.env` files. It defaults to "production" when not defined.

##### 4. Update `package.json`

The name of the CLI was changed to `opennextjs-cloudflare`:

```json
"build:worker": "opennextjs-cloudflare",
```

##### 5 Add `.open-next` to `.gitignore`

You should change `.worker-next` to `.open-next` in your `.gitignore` file to prevent the build output from being committed to your repository.
You can safely delete the content of the now unused `.worker-next`.
