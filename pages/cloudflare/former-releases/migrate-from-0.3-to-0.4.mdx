### Migrate from 0.3 to 0.4

`@opennextjs/cloudflare@0.4.0` introduced a new `initOpenNextCloudflareForDev` utility and made `getCloudflareContext` synchronous,
we'll explore those two differences below, and how they effect applications built using `0.3.x` versions of the adapter.

##### `initOpenNextCloudflareForDev`

`initOpenNextCloudflareForDev` is a new utility that needs to be added to the Next.js configuration file in order to integrate the adapter
with the Next.js dev server. If you don't plan on using the `next dev` command you can skip this section, otherwise update your Next.js
configuration file to import and call the utility.

Example:

```js
// next.config.mjs

import { initOpenNextCloudflareForDev } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";

initOpenNextCloudflareForDev();

/** @type {import('next').NextConfig} */
const nextConfig = {};

export default nextConfig;
```

##### Synchronous `getCloudflareContext` synchronous

`getCloudflareContext` is now synchronous.
a promise that resolves to it.

This means that if you had code that `await`ed `getCloudflareContext()` calls, such `await`s are no longer necessary and
can be removed.

If your application is instead combining the result of `getCloudflareContext()` with on Ecmascript Promises APIs such as
`then`, `catch` and `finally` those need to be removed since the function's result, as mentioned is no longer a promise.
