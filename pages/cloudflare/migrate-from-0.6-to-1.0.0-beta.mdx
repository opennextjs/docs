### Migrate from 0.6 to 1.0.0-beta

The codebase has been refactored with some breaking changes, read-on to update your apps:

#### Name changes

`DurableObjectQueueHandler` was renamed to `DOQueueHandler`. Durable object bindings should be updated in the wrangler configuration file.

#### Environment variables

`NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_MAX_NUM_REVALIDATIONS` was renamed to `NEXT_CACHE_DO_QUEUE_MAX_RETRIES`.

#### API changes

`D1TagCache` was removed. You should use `D1NextModeTagCache` instead which is more efficient and also based on D1.

The `enableShardReplication` and `shardReplicationOptions` options passed to `ShardedDOTagCache`
have been folded into `shardReplication`. A value for `shardReplication` must be specified to enable
replications. The value must be an object with the number of soft and hard replicas.

Before:

```ts
shardedDOTagCache({
  baseShardSize: 4,
  enableShardReplication: true,
  shardReplicationOptions: {
    numberOfSoftReplicas: 4,
    numberOfHardReplicas: 2,
  },
});
```

After:

```ts
shardedDOTagCache({
  baseShardSize: 4,
  shardReplication: {
    numberOfSoftReplicas: 4,
    numberOfHardReplicas: 2,
  },
});
```
