## [NextAuth.js](https://next-auth.js.org/)

NextAuth.js is an open-source authentication solution for Next.js applications.

### Solving a broken build

NextAuth.js relies on [`createCipheriv`](https://nodejs.org/docs/v22.13.1/api/crypto.html#cryptocreatecipherivalgorithm-key-iv-options) from [`node:crypto`](https://nodejs.org/docs/v22.13.1/api/crypto.html).

`createCipheriv` is not currently implemented by the workerd runtime so apps using NextAuth.js with the default configuration break at build time.

However you can configure NextAuth.js to use custom implementations of the `encode` and `decode` functions that do not use the unimplemented Node APIs. Implementations built on top of [`SubtleCrypto`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SubtleCrypto) can run on workerd.

The NextAuth.js configuration file should look like:

```js
import { encode, decode } from "@/lib/webcrypto";

export const NEXT_AUTH_CONFIG = {
  // ...
  jwt: {
    encode,
    decode,
  },
};
```

Kudos to Arnav Gupta ([`@arnavgupta00`](https://github.com/arnavgupta00)) for coming up with the solution.
