## `__name` issues

When using the OpenNext adapter, Wrangler processes the worker's code with [esbuild](https://esbuild.github.io/), and by default
enables the [`keep-names`](https://esbuild.github.io/api/#keep-names) option. While this is generally useful for debugging, it can
cause issues with certain Next.js libraries (e.g. [next-themes](https://www.npmjs.com/package/next-themes)) that convert scripts
to strings. This happens because `esbuild` introduces a `__name` function at the top of modules, which may inadvertently appear
in the generated script strings. When these strings are evaluated at runtime, the `__name` function might therefore not be defined,
leading to errors logged in the developper console:

```
Uncaught ReferenceError: __name is not defined
```

<Callout>
  Note that depending on your minification settings, the `__name` identifier might be minified, making the
  error message less clear and potentially not explicitly mentioning `__name` in such cases.
</Callout>

### How to fix such issues

To fix the issue you can simply set the `keep_names` option to `false` in your [`wrangler.jsonc` file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration), like in the following example:

```jsonc
{
  "$schema": "node_modules/wrangler/config-schema.json",
  "main": ".open-next/worker.js",
  "name": "my-app",
  "keep_names": false,
  /* ... */
}
```

One potential drawback of this solution is that, depending on your minification settings, you may lose the ability to view the original
function names in debugging tools.

<Callout>You must use Wrangler version `4.13.0` or later to use this option.</Callout>
