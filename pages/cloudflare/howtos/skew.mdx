## Skew protection

The Cloudflare adapter has _experimental support_ for skew protection based on [the preview URLs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/previews/).

<Callout type="info">
  Preview URLs are disabled for [Workers that implement a Durable
  Object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/previews/#limitations). If your app uses
  Durable Objects, they will need to be implemented in a separate Worker.
</Callout>

### How to enable the skew protection

**OpenNext config**

Set `cloudflare.skewProtection.enabled` to `true` to enable skew protection:

```ts
// open-next.config.ts
export default {
  // ...
  cloudflare: {
    skewProtection: {
      enabled: true,
      // Maximum number of previous versions to use.
      // Optional, default to 20.
      maxNumberOfVersions: 20,
      // Age of the oldest version to use (from the last deplyment date)
      // Optional, default to 7 days.
      maxVersionAgeDays: 7,
    },
  },
} satisfies OpenNextConfig;
```

**Wrangler configuration**

The Worker needs to serve the correct version of the app assets. For that it need be be executed before incoming requests are matched against the assets. Set [`run_worker_first`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/binding/#run_worker_first) to `tue` in your wrangler configuration to enable this behavior:

```jsonc
// wrangler.jsonc
{
  "name": "my-app",
  // ...
  "assets": {
    "directory": ".open-next/assets",
    "binding": "ASSETS",
    "run_worker_first": true,
  },
  // ...
}
```

**Environment variables**

The following environment variables should be set when the skew protection is used:

- `CF_WORKER_NAME` should be set to the name of the worker, i.e. `my-app` given the config above. If you're using environment, the name of the app should contain your env, i.e. `my-app-<env>`
- `CF_PREVIEW_DOMAIN` is the the subdomain of `workers.dev` where the previews are deployed, i.e. `<version-name>.<domain>.workers.dev`
- `CF_WORKERS_SCRIPTS_API_TOKEN` is an API token with the `Workers Scripts:Read` permission
- `CF_ACCOUNT_ID` is the Cloudflare account id where the app is deployed.

Those variables are used to retrieve the past deployments of your application.

**Next config**

You must set a different `deploymentId` in your next config each time your app is deployed. You will get an error if the `deployementId` has already been used by a previous deployment.

The cloudflare adapter exports a `getDeploymentId()` function that can be used to generate a unique deployment id.

```ts
// next.config.ts
import { getDeploymentId } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";

const nextConfig = {
  // ...
  deploymentId: getDeploymentId(),
};
```

### What you should know

- Because the Worker is configured to run in front of the assets Worker (`run_worker_first`), requesting an asset will count as a request to your Worker
- Requesting an older deployment will generate 2 requests: the request to the latest version and the request to the older version
- It is not currently possible to delete a deployment
- Requests to an older deployment will be a few milli-seconds slower than requests to the latest version of the app
- Request to a deployment older than the `maxNumberOfVersions` or older than `maxVersionAgeDays` will fallback to the current deployment
