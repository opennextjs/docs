## `workerd` specific code

### Configuration

[`workerd`](https://github.com/cloudflare/workerd) is the runtime cloudflare uses to run Workers code.

While the [`nodejs_compat`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/compatibility-flags/#nodejs-compatibility-flag) flag makes `workerd` mostly compatible with Node.js,
there are still minor differences. Some packages publish code for different runtimes to account for those differences. For example, `postgres` has [conditional exports](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#conditional-exports) in its [`package.json`](https://github.com/porsager/postgres/blob/ad0ed4476e09f41f147859cb5a42971d2b99e9c7/package.json#L8-L13):

```json
"exports": {
  "types": "./types/index.d.ts",
  "bun": "./src/index.js",
  "workerd": "./cf/src/index.js",
  "import": "./src/index.js",
  "default": "./cjs/src/index.js"
},
```

With such exports, Node.js applications use either `src/index.js` or `cjs/src/index.js` depending if the app use ESM or CJS.

However we want to use the `workerd` specific entrypoint when using the Cloudflare adapter.
For that, you need to instruct Next.js not to bundle packages as it would use the node conditions by default.

To do that, add those packages in the `serverExternalPackages` key of your `next.config.ts`:

```ts
// node.config.ts
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  serverExternalPackages: ["@prisma/client", ".prisma/client", "postgres"],
};

import { initOpenNextCloudflareForDev } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
initOpenNextCloudflareForDev();

export default nextConfig;
```

### Packages known to have `workerd` specific code

- `@libsql/isomorphic-ws`
- `@prisma/client` (and the generated `.prisma/client`)
- `jose`
- `postgres`
- `react-textarea-autosize`

Please report an issue on [the adapter GH repository](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/issues) to have packages added to this list.
