## Develop and deploy

### Development workflow

The primary purpose of `@opennextjs/cloudflare` is to take a Next.js application, built with standard Next.js tooling, and convert it into a format compatible with Cloudflare Workers.

This code transformation process takes some time, making the adapter less than ideal for active application development, where a very fast feedback loop and other quality-of-life features, such as Hot Module Replacement (HMR), are crucial. Fortunately, Vercel already provides excellent tooling for this workflow, which Next.js developers are likely already familiar with.

We recommend that developers continue using the tools they are already comfortable with for local development and then use `@opennextjs/cloudflare` when they are ready to deploy their applications to the Cloudflare platform.

Let's explore, in more detail, the application development workflow we recommend for the best developer experience.

#### Create a new application based on a template

To create a new Next.js app, pre-configured to run on Cloudflare using `@opennextjs/cloudflare`, run:

```bash
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-next-app --framework=next --platform=workers
```

#### Develop locally using `next dev`

We believe that the best development workflow uses the `next dev` command provided by Next.js.

To access Cloudflare resources using the `getCloudflareContext` API while running `next dev`, you will need to update the Next.js configuration to call `initOpenNextCloudflareForDev`, as shown in the following example:

```ts
// next.config.ts
import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  /* config options here */
};

export default nextConfig;

import { initOpenNextCloudflareForDev } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";
initOpenNextCloudflareForDev();
```

#### Use `opennextjs-cloudflare` to build and test on the Workers runtime

After you've finished iterating on your Next.js application with `next dev`, you can convert it to a Cloudflare Worker by running the `opennextjs-cloudflare build` command. This will generate the Worker code in the `.open-next` directory.

You can then preview the app locally in the Cloudflare Workers runtime.

To preview your worker locally, run the `opennextjs-cloudflare preview` command. This will populate the cache and create a local server that runs your worker in the Cloudflare Workers runtime. Testing your worker is important to ensure that it has been properly built and is working as expected.

### Deploy your application to Cloudflare Workers

Both the `deploy` and `upload` commands of `opennextjs-cloudflare` can be used to deploy your application to cloudflare Workers. Both commands will initialize the remote cache and upload your application to the Cloudflare infrastructure.

While `deploy` will start serving your application as soon as it is uploaded, `upload` only creates a new version of the application so that you can use [gradual deployments](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/configuration/versions-and-deployments/gradual-deployments/).

#### Local build

Use the `build` command followed by either `deploy` or `upload` to deploy your local build.

<Callout type="warning">
  When running the `build` command locally, `.dev.vars` and [Next `.env`
  files](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages/building-your-application/configuring/environment-variables) might
  override your configuration. It is preferreable to use a CD system as [Workers
  Builds](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/) to deploy your application for reproducible
  deployments.
</Callout>

#### Workers Builds

When using Workers Builds, make sure to setup your environment variables as explained in [this guide](https://opennext.js.org/cloudflare/howtos/env-vars#production).

You can then connect your GitHub repository by following [the documentation](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/ci-cd/builds/git-integration/).

In the Build settings:

- The "Build command" should be set to `npx opennextjs-cloudflare build`.
- The "Deploy command" should be set to `npx opennextjs-cloudflare deploy` (or `upload` to use gradual deployments).

<Callout type="info">
  The `deploy`, `upload`, and `populateCache` commands of `opennextjs-cloudflare` invoke `wrangler`.
  You can pass arguments to `wrangler` by specifying them after `--`:

```sh
opennextjs-cloudflare deploy -- --env=prod
```

</Callout>
