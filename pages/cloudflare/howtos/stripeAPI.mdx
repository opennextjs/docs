## [Stripe API](https://www.npmjs.com/package/stripe)

When [creating a Stripe object](https://docs.stripe.com/js/initializing), the default http client implementation is based on `node:https` which is not implemented on Workers.

However you can use an http client based on fetch ([`FetchHttpClient`](https://github.com/stripe/stripe-node/blob/54d423e5d1118dc35c4b76260889826003e00e9f/src/net/FetchHttpClient.ts)) via the `httpClient` option:

```ts
import Stripe from "stripe";

const stripe = Stripe(STRIPE_API_KEY, {
  // Cloudflare Workers use the Fetch API for their API requests.
  httpClient: Stripe.createFetchHttpClient()
});
```
