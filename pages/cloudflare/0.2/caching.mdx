## Caching

`@opennextjs/cloudflare` supports [caching](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#caching-data) and [revalidating](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/fetching-caching-and-revalidating#revalidating-data) data returned by subrequests you make in your app by calling [`fetch()`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/fetch/).

By default, all `fetch()` subrequests made in your Next.js app are cached. Refer to the [Next.js documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#opting-out-1) for information about how to disable caching for an individual subrequest, or for an entire route.

[The cache persists across deployments](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/caching#data-cache). You are responsible for revalidating/purging this cache.

Workers KV is eventually consistent, which means that it can take up to 60 seconds for updates to be reflected globally, when using the default TTL of 60 seconds.

### How to enable caching

`@opennextjs/cloudflare` uses [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/kv/) as the cache for your Next.js app. Workers KV is [fast](https://blog.cloudflare.com/faster-workers-kv) and uses Cloudflare's [Tiered Cache](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cache/how-to/tiered-cache/) to increase cache hit rates. When you write cached data to Workers KV, you write to storage that can be read by any Cloudflare location. This means your app can fetch data, cache it in KV, and then subsequent requests anywhere around the world can read from this cache.

To enable caching, you must:

#### 1. Create a KV namespace

```
npx wrangler@latest kv namespace create <YOUR_NAMESPACE_NAME>
```

#### 2. Add the KV namespace to your Worker

The binding name used in your app's worker will be `NEXT_CACHE_WORKERS_KV` by default. This is configurable and can be changed by setting the `__OPENNEXT_KV_BINDING_NAME` build-time environment variable.

```
[[kv_namespaces]]
binding = "NEXT_CACHE_WORKERS_KV"
id = "<YOUR_NAMESPACE_ID>"
```
