## Cloudflare

The [`@opennextjs/cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/cloudflare) adapter lets you deploy Next.js apps to [Cloudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers) using the [Node.js "runtime" from Next.js](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes).

<Callout>
[`@opennextjs/cloudflare`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/cloudflare) is pre 1.0, and still in active development. You should try it, [report bugs](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/issues), [share feedback](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/discussions), and contribute code to help make running Next.js apps on Cloudflare easier. We don't quite yet recommend using it for mission-critical production apps.

You can also use [`@cloudflare/next-on-pages`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@cloudflare/next-on-pages) to deploy Next.js apps to Cloudflare Pages. You can review the differences in supported Next.js features below and by reviewing [the docs for `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`](https://developers.cloudflare.com/pages/framework-guides/nextjs/ssr/supported-features/), and understand the differences between Workers and Pages [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/static-assets/compatibility-matrix/).

### Get Started

##### New apps

To create a new Next.js app, pre-configured to run on Cloudflare using @opennextjs/cloudflare, run:

```
npm create cloudflare@latest -- my-next-app --framework=next --experimental
```

##### Existing Next.js apps

Follow the guide [here](/cloudflare/get-started) to use [@opennextjs/cloudflare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/cloudflare) with an existing Next.js app.

### Supported Next.js runtimes

Next.js has [two "runtimes"](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/edge-and-nodejs-runtimes) â€” "Edge" and "Node.js". When you use `@opennextjs/cloudflare`, your app should use the Node.js runtime, which is more fully featured, and allows you to use the [Node.js APIs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/nodejs/) that are provided by the Cloudflare Workers runtime.

This is an important difference from `@cloudflare/next-on-pages`, which only supports the "Edge" runtime. The Edge Runtime code in Next.js [intentionally constrains which APIs from Node.js can be used](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/blob/canary/packages/next/src/build/webpack/plugins/middleware-plugin.ts#L820), and the "Edge" runtime does not support all Next.js features.

### Supported Next.js versions

`@opennextjs/cloudflare` is pre 1.0, and still in active development. We intend to support all minor and patch versions of Next.js 14 and 15.

To help improve compatibility, we encourage you to [report bugs](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/issues) and contribute code!

### Supported Next.js features

Some Next.js features are not yet supported are not fully tested.
We will update the list as we progress towards releasing 1.0.

- [x] [Image optimization](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/images) (you can integrate Cloudflare Images with Next.js by following [this guide](https://developers.cloudflare.com/images/transform-images/integrate-with-frameworks/))
- [ ] [Pages Router](https://nextjs.org/docs/pages) (you should use the App Router instead, which was introduced in Next.js 13)
- [ ] [Incremental Static Regeneration (ISR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/data-fetching/incremental-static-regeneration)
- [ ] [Partial Prerendering (PPR)](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/rendering/partial-prerendering)
- [ ] [Support for after](https://nextjs.org/blog/next-15-rc#executing-code-after-a-response-with-nextafter-experimental)
- [ ] [Composable Caching](https://nextjs.org/blog/composable-caching) (`'use cache'`) is a Next.js 15 feature and not supported yet.

We welcome both contributions and feedback!

### How @opennextjs/cloudflare Works

The OpenNext Cloudflare adapter works by taking the Next.js build output and transforming it, so that it can run in Cloudflare Workers.

When you add [@opennextjs/cloudflare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/cloudflare) as a dependency to your Next.js app, and then run `npx opennextjs-cloudflare` the adapter first builds your app by running the `build` script in your `package.json`, and then transforms the build output to a format that you can run locally using [Wrangler](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/), and deploy to Cloudflare.

You can view the code for @opennextjs/cloudflare [here](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/blob/main/packages/cloudflare/src) to understand what it does under the hood.
