### Bindings

[Bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) allow your Worker to interact with resources on the Cloudflare Developer Platform. When you declare a binding on your Worker, you grant it a specific capability, such as being able to read and write files to an [R2](https://developers.cloudflare.com/r2/) bucket.

#### How to configure your Next.js app so it can access bindings

Install [@opennextjs/cloudflare](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@opennextjs/cloudflare), and then add a `wrangler.toml` file in the root directory of your Next.js app, as described in [Get Started](/cloudflare/get-started).

#### How to access bindings in your Next.js app

You can access [bindings](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/bindings/) from any route of your Next.js app via `getCloudlfareContext`:

```js
import { getCloudflareContext } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";

export async function GET(request) {
	let responseText = "Hello World";

	const myKv = (await getCloudflareContext()).env.MY_KV_NAMESPACE;
	await myKv.put("foo", "bar");
	const foo = await myKv.get("foo");

	return new Response(foo);
}
```

#### How to add bindings to your Worker

Add bindings to your Worker by [adding them to your `wrangler.toml` configuration file](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/configuration/).

## TypeScript type declarations for bindings

To ensure that the `env` object from `(await getCloudflareContext()).env` above has accurate TypeScript types, run the following Wrangler command to [generate types that match your Worker's configuration](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/languages/typescript/#generate-types-that-match-your-workers-configuration-experimental):

```
npx wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime
```

This will generate a `d.ts` file and (by default) save it to `.wrangler/types/runtime.d.ts`. You will be prompted in the command's output to add that file to your `tsconfig.json`'s `compilerOptions.types` array.

If you would like to commit the file to git, you can provide a custom path. Here, for instance, the `runtime.d.ts` file will be saved to the root of your project:

```bash
npx wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime="./runtime.d.ts"
```

To ensure that your types are always up-to-date, make sure to run `wrangler types --experimental-include-runtime` after any changes to your config file.

## Other Cloudflare APIs (`cf`, `ctx`)

You can access context about the incoming request from the [`cf` object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/request/#the-cf-property-requestinitcfproperties), as well as lifecycle methods from the [`ctx` object](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/context) from the return value of [`getCloudflareContext()`](https://github.com/opennextjs/opennextjs-cloudflare/blob/main/packages/cloudflare/src/api/get-cloudflare-context.ts):

```js
import { getCloudflareContext } from "@opennextjs/cloudflare";


export async function GET(request) {
	const { env, cf, ctx } = await getCloudflareContext();

	// ...
}
```
