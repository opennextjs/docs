# OpenNext

Next.js, unlike Remix, Astro, or the other modern frontends, doesn't have a way to self-host across different platforms. You can run it as a Node.js application. But this doesn't work the same way as it does on Vercel.

---

There have been several attempts to fix this over the years. Broadly falling into two categories; open source framework specific implementations, or closed source product specific implementations.

These can be really hard to maintain separately as Next.js is constantly being updated.

OpenNext is an initiative to bring all these efforts together.
