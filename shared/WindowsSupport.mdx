OpenNext can be used on Windows systems but Windows full support is not guaranteed because:
 - historically the Next.js tooling itself has had Windows support issues
   (and OpenNext is built on these tools)
 - the OpenNext team has limited capacity and fully supporting Windows (given the point above)
   has been determined to be a lower priority, thus the effort and testing on Windows is limited

Given the above, you can develop your application under Windows at your own risk. If you don't have an alternative we
recommend either:
 - running OpenNext using [WSL2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/),
 - in a Linux Virtual Machine or
 - develop your application using the standard Next.js tooling and deploy it using OpenNext in CI/CD systems such
   as [GitHub Actions](https://github.com/features/actions) that run linux/MacOS environments
